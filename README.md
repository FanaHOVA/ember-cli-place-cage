# Ember-cli-place-cage

An Ember wrapper for [PlaceCage](http://www.placecage.com/)! Thanks to [@davecowart](https://twitter.com/davecowart) for creating the website and to Nicolas Cage for being born. 

## Installation

* `npm install ember-cli-place-cage`

## Usage

The place-cage component will create an <img> tag in your template with the desired image:

* `{{place-cage width=300 height=300 style='c'}}`
 
Width and height are self-descriptive. The style tag has 4 options:

* '' will give you a normal Nicolas Cage photo (If there's even such a thing)
* 'g' will give you a deeply moving and emotional black and white Nicolas Cage photo
* 'c' will show you a crazy photo of our hero Nicolas Cage
* 'gif' will bring Nicolas Cage to life in your app (Run at your own risk)

## TODO

* Add Nicolas Cage quotes for 'alt' attribute
